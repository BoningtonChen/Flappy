# Flappy

## Description
This is a rust-built game by bracket-lib.

## How to USE
To clone the repository with git clone, run the following command: \
`git clone https://github.com/BoningtonChen/Flappy.git` on GitHub (100% SURE Up-to-Date). \
or \
`git clone https://gitee.com/bonington/Flappy.git` on Gitee (Faster in Chinese Mainland). \
You may need to install `git` and `rustup` tools first.

## FAQ
1. If you come across failure while building, you may need to run `rustup default nightly`, since the program is build by `rustc 1.73.0-nightly`. By the time I built the program, all `rustc 1.70.0`,`rustc 1.71.0-beta.6` and `rustc 1.73.0-nightly` versions are available.
